# Requirements before  running the 
# 	sources code

# There is one requirement before running the code successfully
# choosing one way to prepare it.

##1: Uncomment the following code - This is easier than the #2 method

Consider this commment in the sources code:

	#### Fixing the missing Firefox geckodirver 
	# import geckodriver_autoinstaller
	# geckodriver_autoinstaller.install()
	
Before you uncomment the code and re-run it, make sure you install the 'geckodriver_autoinstaller' module
If you haven't installed it, please run this script:
	pip install geckodriver-autoinstaller OR
	pip3 install geckodriver-autoinstaller


##2: Copy the 'geckodriver' file to the system's binary directory. 
In Linux, you can copy the file to '/usr/bin' or '/usr/local/bin'
and re-run the code. (For Firefox-only)

The file is attached in the same directory of the source code

If you are using Chrome or other Browser, consider to do the #1 method or go to Duckduckgo to
asking 'how to install geckodriver for Chrome/Safari... on Windows/Ubuntu...
